        <ol>
            <li>Make meatballs: Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir
                onion and salt in hot butter until onion turns translucent, about 6 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer onion mixture to a large bowl. Stir in eggs, bread crumbs, milk, black pepper,
                nutmeg, allspice, and cayenne. Mix in ground beef and pork until well combined. Cover the 
                bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>Make gravy: Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; whisk in flour and cook until
                golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Slowly whisk in beef broth. Increase heat to medium-high, whisk
                in cream, and bring to a simmer. Stir in sugar and Worcestershire. Simmer until slightly thickened,
                6 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper. Remove from heat and set aside.
            </li>
